This is a JavaScript implementation of a Sudoku solver, which can solve Sudoku puzzles and display the solution. The solver is based on a recursive algorithm that searches for a solution by trying all possible values for each cell until a valid solution is found.

The code is written in ES6 and uses modern web technologies such as HTML and CSS to display the Sudoku board and user interface.
